# Universal-Recommendation Generator

## Introduction

Our system provides a universal model for the recommendation of products across various categories. Recommendations are generated using the clustering of similar products. As attributes vary between different categories of products, clustering may start requiring manual intervention. Since, our system will store and make searchable semi-structured product data, it will not require any fixed data type. It will also allow the user to select attributes on which to cluster and give preference to the same. Then, the system will generate recommendations on textual data, while filters will be applied for numerical data.

## After cloning

Run `npm install -g @angular/cli gh-pages`

Then `npm install` by `cd`ing into cloned directory

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
